## Overview

This repository contains a clean, responsive static HTML/CSS landing page for a small bookstore called **Rete Neurale**. The design features an animated header (stars, moon, mountains, boat) and a product section listing sample books with prices. It's intended as a lightweight promotional site or portfolio piece.

## Features

* Animated parallax-style header scene (stars, moon, mountains, river, boat).
* Simple, responsive layout for content and product grid.
* Product cards with image, title, and price placeholders.
* Easy-to-edit HTML and CSS, suitable for static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

## Files

* `index.html` — main page (the HTML you provided).
* `css/style_homePage.css` — styles for the page (link referenced in `index.html`).
* `main.js` — JavaScript file (referenced at bottom of `index.html`) for interactivity/animations (create or extend as needed).
* `/asses/` — folder for images and assets (stars, moon, mountains, book covers, etc.).

> Note: Ensure the `assets` folder path is correct. In the HTML the images use `/asses/...` (leading slash) which refers to the server root — for local development change them to `assets/...` or `./assets/...`.

## Installation & Local Preview

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

2. Serve locally (simple options):

* Using VS Code Live Server extension — open the folder and click *Go Live*.
* Using Python HTTP server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## How to customize

* Change site title and copy by editing `<h2 class="rete_neurale">` and the `.content` section in `index.html`.
* Replace book images in `/asses/` with your own images and update the product titles/prices.
* Adjust layout and colors in `css/style_homePage.css`.
* If you want responsive images, consider using `srcset` and properly sized cover images.

## Accessibility & Best Practices (quick tips)

* Add meaningful `alt` text for each product image (currently they are generic). Example: `alt="Book cover: Think and Grow Rich"`.
* Avoid using large file names with spaces — rename `think and grow rich .jpeg` to `think-and-grow-rich.jpeg`.
* Use relative asset paths (no leading `/`) for easier GitHub Pages deployment.
* Consider lazy-loading images: `<img loading="lazy" ...>` for faster initial loads.

## Deployment

* Push the repository to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings (branch: `main` or `gh-pages`).
* Alternatively, drag-and-drop the folder to Netlify or connect the repo to Vercel for instant deployment.

## Suggested README badges (optional)

* GitHub Pages, license, build status (if you add CI), or a demo link.

## License

Choose a license (for example MIT). Add a `LICENSE` file if you want others to reuse your work.

If you want, I can:

* Provide a ready-to-use `style_homePage.css` and `main.js` to match the HTML.
* Convert the README to Arabic.
* Prepare a deploy-ready `index.html` with corrected asset paths and optimized images.

Tell me which one you want next.
